> Frontend Research for Leveling Up as an Engineer

Hey 👋🏽! This is a *Zettelkasten* to collect knowledge on different web development topics so I can be not just a competent engineer but a *good* one.

Here you'll find notes from different courses, blog posts, and books I've read on the topic of React, web development, JavaScript, API design, and backend engineering, perhaps maybe even a little *DevOps*.

You can jump around the site using the *Wiki links* below.
